# Rock-Paper-Scissors

## Java Script Rock Paper Scissors game

This is a project for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors). It is built with the Odin Projects requirements in mind to create a Rock Paper Scissors game that can be palyed in the borwsers console against the computer.
I revisited this project to add a GUI and experimented alot with design, styling and created some animations for the first time. I learned a lot about dynamic DOM manipulation to make this work.
